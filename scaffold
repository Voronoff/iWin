Description:
    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
    views, along with a full test suite. The resource is ready to use as a
    starting point for your RESTful, resource-oriented application.

    Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
    pairs.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, 'scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean'
    gives you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an index that lists them all, as well as a map.resources :posts
    declaration in config/routes.rb.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, run
    'script/destroy scaffold ModelName'.

Examples:
    `./script/generate scaffold post`
    `./script/generate scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    `./script/generate scaffold purchase order_id:integer amount:decimal`

Once finished, don't forget to:

- Add routes to these resources. In config/routes.rb, insert routes like:
    map.signup '/signup', :controller => 'users', :action => 'new'
    map.login  '/login',  :controller => 'sessions', :action => 'new'
    map.logout '/logout', :controller => 'sessions', :action => 'destroy'

----------------------------------------------------------------------

We've create a new site key in config/initializers/site_keys.rb.  If you have existing
user accounts their passwords will no longer work (see README). As always,
keep this file safe but don't post it in public.
